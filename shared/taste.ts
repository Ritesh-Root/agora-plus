/**
 * The Taste Council contract, shared by the server (server/taste/*) and the Home page (src/home/Taste*).
 *
 * A household fact such as "Mia loves Encanto" or "Dadi is 74" becomes a taste signal. The council asks
 * Qloo (through the local `qloo mcp` server) for candidates per person, ranks the shared shortlist once
 * per person, and picks by maximin: the option whose worst per-person rank is best, so nobody is left out.
 * Keeper then removes anything that conflicts with an allergy or diet fact. Nothing here is a probability
 * about a person; Qloo results are aggregate affinities.
